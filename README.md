Programs are very basic, the only thing is that you need to use the END command to end a program, you cannot program after using END.  
**Note:** you can't use identation, maybe in the feature this will change.  

### Print:
to print you should use the **.** command.  
>.Hello World  
to print variables use the '>' command.  
> '>'var
